# CNN-MNIST-NUMPY-ONLY

This project involves developing a neural network composd of 1 hidden layer along with 1 input layer and 1 output layer. In developing this neural network, no machine learning libraries were used such as Tensorflow but rather this neural network is built only with numpy and linear algebra.
